# STM32_UART_Receive_DMA_Shell_Function
STM32_UART_Receive_DMA_Shell_Function

This code could enable a sample on the STM32 UART DMA sample code.

But there is a issue, you need to input the shell cmd very accurately, and if you type the wrong wrong words and you need to put 'Enter' key and re-type again.

this issue will be fix in later version.

current this code only support the '--help' and '--version' function.
